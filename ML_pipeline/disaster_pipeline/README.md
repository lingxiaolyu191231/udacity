# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Project Usage:
When natural disasters come, thousands or millions of messages will be sent. Important information is embeded in those message. This pipeline will first process those message data collected from social media such as facebook or instagram in the ETL pipeline and then Machine Learning pipeline to classify those message into one or more categories that will help filter the main information of those messages. A final data visualization will be presented in the local port. 

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
