### Project Motivation
<p Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA. Seattle Airbnb is a open-source data on Kaggle. This project is used for exploring airbnbs in Seattle to answer following questions:>
1. Property characteristics of each Seattle neighborhood
2. Which months of the year are busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
3. How much does the increase of demand influence the price?
4. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle overtime?

### File Descriptions (total 3)
1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

### Findings:
1. Capitol Hill has the most listing properties with Downtown in the second place and Central Area as the third. The downtown area has the highest mean host_listings_count, median host_listings_counts, and a more varied host_listings_count. Same pattern could be found in host_total_listings_count with the highest mean, median, standard deviation of host_total_listings_counts.
Magnolia shows an advantage of hosting more residents, as compared to other neighbors, has more bathrooms, bedrooms, beds available, more guests that be included.
Thus, even though downtown offers more airbnb choices, it is recommended to choose an airbnb in Magnolia neighborhood because it is likely to have more spaces, thus leading to a more pleasing experience.
2. The peak of average airbnb price is in July with August as the month with the second highest price.
3. As compared to January to April, July and August exhibit much higher prices, approximately up by 10 to 15% on average.
4. Ther is an upward trend for airbnb listings over time, with some seasonality. Meanwhile, the visitor counts also increase as the reviews of airbnb bookings increase over these years.
